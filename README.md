## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is related to the Nipah virus. It includes various features that are used to analyze and predict outcomes. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file and includes both categorical and numerical data.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GaddamVarshith/Nipah-Virus-Dataset-Analysis-and-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning.git
    cd nipah-dataset-analysis
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Run the data preprocessing and model training script:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Explore the Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis:**

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Nipah_Data_Analysis.ipynb
    ```
